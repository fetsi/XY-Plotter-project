# XY-Plotter-project
A school project where we wrote the firmware needed to operate a Makeblock XY plotter. The device operates electric stepper motors on two axes to guide a robot arm holding a pencil.  Our firmware interprets G-codes (2D coordinates) sent via USB from the mDraw software running on a PC. This way the device is able to draw 2D images on paper. The code was written for the NXP LPC1549 microcontroller. Other contributors to the project are Simo Hyttinen and Mikko Peltola from Metropolia UAS.
